## 0.1.1 Pre-release Update
- This version adds separate compendia for focuses, relationships, specializations, stunts, and talents. The previous compound compendia for scenes, actors, and items are retained for now.

## 0.1.0 Initial pre-release
- This version is for testing basic content delivery, module structure, etc. for a module with another dependent module. This module is specifically intended to capture copyrighted material I've extracted from personally owned resources for personal use in my games where I also want to be able to coordinate this information across different computers via a GitHub repository. In particular this facilitates captureing some additional material I do not want to include in the dependent shareable module. No effort has been made to minimize file sizes, and in many cases there may even be some duplication.
