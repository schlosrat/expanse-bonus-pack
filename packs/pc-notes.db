Your ancestors were some of the first settlers in the Mariner Valley, and you were raised to be proud of that heritage and everything Mars was looking to achieve. Although earlier generations of your family were technicians and engineers, you were always one of the bigger and stronger kids, and there was no doubt that you were going to sign on with the Martian military. Turns out, however, that military superiors like their orders followed and, well, sometimes you thought that you knew better. After you left the service, you tried your hand working private security in the Outer Planets, with pretty much the same results.

You did well enough in school, but spent a lot of time exploring the unused areas of the station.

That meant the end of higher education and finishing pre-med for you, and you and your father haven’t spoken since he bailed you out.

A large wooden veneer desk dominates one end of the room. There are some family pictures on the desk and the walls as well as a painting of Joseph Smith kneeling and holding the golden plates as an angelic being floats above. Another painting depicts the Mormon Temple on Earth at sunrise. A large black, leather-bound book, The Book of Mormon etched in gold on the front, sits in a prominent place on the desk.

Dr. Bragenholm vanished about three months ago and Dr. Cerri just over three weeks ago. When Dr. Bragenholm went missing, we thought maybe it was of her own volition, but with Dr. Cerri’s disappearance this is starting to look like a pattern; either someone wants to sabotage the Nauvoo project, or they wanted our scientists for some other purpose. We have, umm... concerns about Fred Johnson and the OPA. Some of our members are suspicious that they might be involved somehow, which is why we are turning to you for help. Either way, we want them back!” </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Dr. Anna Bragenholm is 32 years old and has the tall and slender build of a person born outside a gravity well (in her case, on Luna). Her face is also long and narrow with prominent cheekbones, deep-set blue eyes, and long, straw-colored hair that she usually wears back in a pony-tail. </p>\n<p>Clues:</p>\n<p>1. Dr. Bragenholm is an ECLSS (environmental control and life support specialist) engineer who has been working with the Nauvoo project for over five years and is responsible for the design of much of its environmental systems.</p>\n<p>2. She is single with no family. Her parents and younger sister were killed when a rogue asteroid struck the transport they were traveling on 14 years ago. Anna was away at college at the time.</p>\n<p>3. She was last seen leaving her station in the Nauvoo Project offces three months ago at 5:24 PM (Tycho Station time).</p>\n<p>4. She was a bit of a loner and tended to keep to herself. She is known to be a devout Mormon and attends services regularly, though she rarely attends social activities.</p>\n<p>5. She had recently expressed some dissatisfaction and boredom in her work as the project neared completion. She has also had some friction with co-workers. </p>\n<p>6. About two months before she disappeared, she mentioned to one of her co-workers that she had received an interesting job offer for a lot more money. She claimed to have turned it down because she didn’t want to lose her spot on the <em>Nauvoo</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr. Cerri is 47 years old, from Earth, and has a short and squat build even for an Earther. He has jagged short hair that he dyes neon blue, dark brown eyes with bushy eyebrows, and a square, cleft jaw. He often has a few days of stubble.</p>\n<p>Clues:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div title=\"Page 4\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>1. Dr. Matteo Cerri is a biochemist/neurophysiologist who worked alongside the ECLSS engineers to make sure the passengers on board the Nauvoo would be safe and healthy during their voyage. He has been with the Nauvoo project for three years.</p>\n<p>2. He is married to Fiona Tan and they have two children, Alexa and Cesare (17 and 13). All of them live on board Tycho Station.</p>\n<p>3. He was last seen leaving his station in the Nauvoo project o\u000fces a little over three weeks ago at 6:33 PM (Tycho Station time).</p>\n<p>4. They regularly attend Mormon services but are not considered to be the most devout. Cerri’s wife has been known to speak out against some Mormon policies, particularly a lack of leadership roles for women amongst the clergy.</p>\n<p>5. He is well-liked and respected by the other members of his team, very engaged and often organizing after-work outings and activities. He is also widely regarded as one of the best in his field. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wypGoDpbSltPFEBU":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YBumZzXZSxEv277x"},"cf":{"id":"temp_lwq8oujmpxk","path":"PC Notes","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.expanse-bonus-pack.pc-notes.KJbJxyC5GYDb8rAy"}}}

The cameras show him leaving work and heading toward home. As he passes through a crowded market area, the cameras lose him. According to Tycho Station security, the cameras in that area were vandalized. Further seraching the security cam records showed Dr. Cerri being escorted through a docking area by two burly men in generic-looking jumpsuits. They are leading him so that his face mostly avoids the cameras, but he turns his head a couple of times, allowing him to be identified.</p>\n<p>Dr. Cerri was seen boarding the <em>Ebenezer Hazard</em>, a Pope-Sanchez Shipping cargo hauler, in the company of two men wearing PSS jumpsuits. His body language indicates that he is not going willingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While investigating on the Tycho docks, the players were approached by a young belter woman identifying herself as Nicola asking for help. She explained that she overheard the characters asking around about the missing scientists and that her boyfriend, Pedro Gwong, also went missing about three weeks ago. She told them that he left their hole early in the morning, saying that he had a possible lead on a job, but he never came back. She’s also learned that at least three other Belters went missing around the same time. All of them were unemployed and looking for work. She’s able to provide a picture of Gwong and one of the other missing Belters, a woman named Liz Greene. She doesn’t have any other information on the other two.</p>\n<p>Reviewing the Tycho Security video logs confirms that at least 6 belters got \"escorted\" onto the <em>Ebeneezer Hazzard</em> before it left on the trip with Dr. Cerri aboard. Two of those match the pictures of Pedro and Liz supplied by Nicola.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 5\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It's public record, and in fact advertised, that the <em>Ebenezer Hazard</em> is currently making a routine round-trip mail/delivery run from Tycho Station to Vesta. The Hazard is scheduled to dock tomorrow and leaves two days later. Digging a little further reveals that during both trips with the kidnapped scientists (and Belters), their flight plan took 14 hours longer than the usual run. Analyzing navigational charts reveal that there is an abandoned mining facility on an asteroid called 532 Herculina that would require a detour of almost exactly 14 hours. Based on an inquiry with the port authority on Vesta the players learn that no passengers fitting the names or descriptions of the two scientists or any of the other missing Belters disembarked on Vesta.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wypGoDpbSltPFEBU":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.3AaNiUT26z4CQ7cU"},"cf":{"id":"temp_lwq8oujmpxk","path":"PC Notes","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.expanse-bonus-pack.pc-notes.scUdjZUk5SbVpBuN"}}}

Your parents were well-educated, your father an engineering teacher and your mother a botanist, at least until she got sick. You did well enough in school, but spent a lot of time exploring the unused areas of the station. After your mother died, you and your dad kind of drifted apart, and you became more and more involved with Belter political causes, which led you to the Outer Planets Alliance. OPA friends benefitted from your knack for getting around station security, but that didn’t keep you from getting into trouble. That meant the end of higher education and finishing pre-med for you, and you and your father haven’t spoken since he bailed you out.

Your ancestors were some of the first settlers in the Mariner Valley, and you were raised to be proud of that heritage and everything Mars was looking to achieve. Although earlier generations of your family were technicians and engineers, you were always one of the bigger and stronger kids, and there was no doubt that you were going to sign on with the Martian military. Turns out, however, that military superiors like their orders followed and, well, sometimes you thought that you knew better. After you left the service, you tried your hand working private security in the Outer Planets, with pretty much the same results.
