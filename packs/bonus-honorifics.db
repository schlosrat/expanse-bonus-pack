When they tell someone of their honorific, or impart the </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19589\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">story of how they gained it, they gain a psychological edge. In an opposed test involving the character&rsquo;s famed skill or natural </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19590\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">ability, opponents suffer a -1 penalty to their opposing roll as they second-guess their actions while up against a known expert.</span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19591\"></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19592\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">SUPPORTIVE REPUTATION</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19593\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Characters also benefit mechanically when others, friends or foes, invoke their honorific in support of their actions. This use </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19594\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">of reputation requires someone other than the character to talk up their title or tell convincing stories of the deeds required </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19595\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to earn it to someone outside of the character&rsquo;s party. During the scene this occurs in, the character with the reputation </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19596\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">being supported gains a +2 bonus to any roll in which they demonstrate the abilities they&rsquo;re known for. A renowned hacker </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19597\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">gets in the zone when the chat room they&rsquo;re in posts nothing but memes about them, while a superlative lover is at their </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19598\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">most seductive when approaching a potential one night stand in view of an awed rival.</span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19600\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">INSPIRED REPUTATION</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19601\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A character using their honorific outside of their field of interest or expertise is calling on it for an inspired purpose. Examples </span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19602\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">include the Bane of the Belt telling stories of their assaults on OPA terrorist cells to win the trust of a group of Martian merce</span></span><span id=\"page1594R_mcid19604\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">naries, or a famously loyal bodyguard invoking numerous injuries they received in the line of duty to convince a reluctant</span></span>doctor to trust them during a tense triage.

When dealing with a group or individual </span></span><span id=\"page1599R_mcid19620\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">aware of a character&rsquo;s reputation and likely to be affected by it directly, GMs should color the interaction appropriately. A character </span></span><span id=\"page1599R_mcid19621\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">considered true OPA is likely to be warmly received in a bar near the center of Ceres, but security contractors working for Earth </span></span><span id=\"page1599R_mcid19622\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">are likely to stop and frisk them with little provocation. In social situations, characters benefit from a free single step attitude shift </span></span><span id=\"page1599R_mcid19623\"><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">in the direction suited to their reputation. This step isn&rsquo;t always positive, as some people will dislike or mistrust a given honorific.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","favorite":false,"reference":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wypGoDpbSltPFEBU":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.6IOCJ4WkQWTxGCCL"},"cf":{"id":"temp_obq4koe5lmd","path":"Honorifics","color":"#000000"}}}
