A character considered true OPA is likely to be warmly received in a bar near the center of Ceres, but security contractors working for Earth are likely to stop and frisk them with little provocation. In social situations, characters benefit from a free single step attitude shift in the direction suited to their reputation. This step isn&rsquo;t always positive, as some people will dislike or mistrust a given honorific.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 219\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","favorite":false,"reference":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wypGoDpbSltPFEBU":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.0NKe1gPczPJ0w6vR"}}}
